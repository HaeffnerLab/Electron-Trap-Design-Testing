# Electron-Trap-Design-Testing
This repository is for the files needed in testing the electron trap designs. 

The frequency response folder includes files that test the frequency response of the RF electrodes of the trap while feeding in RF signals with different frequencies.

The ion trap sim folder is for simulations of particle trajectories inside an ion trap.

The files that simulate electron trajectories inside an electron trap are under the home directory.
