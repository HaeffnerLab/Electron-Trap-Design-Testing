# Electron-Trap-Design-Testing
This repository is for the files needed in testing the electron trap designs. 

The DC_Confinement folder includes programs that are used to calculate the DC electrode voltages for the axial confinement potentials.

The frequency response folder includes files that test the frequency response of the RF electrodes of the trap while feeding in RF signals with different frequencies.

The particle_trajectory_sim folder includes files that are used for particle trajectory simulations for trapped electrons/ions as well as electron extraction from the trap. It includes a well-documented file trap_util.py that contains functions that are needed for particle trajectory simulation (accompanied by a trap_util_example.ipynb file that includes examples of using these functions). Other files within the folder are mainly programs that are used to explore/test various properties of the traps.
