This folder contains a trap_util.py file that provides basic particle trajectory simulation functions, an example of using trap_util.py (trap_util_example.ipynb), some electric field data .fld files given by finite element simulatio (these files are used in particle trajectory simulations), and some particle simulation files for ion traps and electron traps.

If you want to use particle simulation code, all you need to read is trap_util.py and trap_util.ipynb.
